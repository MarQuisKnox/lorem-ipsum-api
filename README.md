# Lorem Ipsum Generator API

This repo is the code that powers the API I recently added to Mashape.com, the API marketplace.  I just wanted to share as an example of a super simple API that's leveraging a lot of awesome open source software.

## Installation

#### Requirements
- Apache
- PHP 5.3+
- cURL
- composer

#### Command Line
```
git clone https://github.com/montanaflynn/lorem-ipsum-api.git
cd lorem-ipsum-api
composer install
# That's all folks
```

## Usage
Documentation is provided on Mashape here: https://www.mashape.com/montanaflynn/lorem-text-generator#documentation


## Credits
Composer, Slim, Faker are the three main components that make this API.  The only file I created merely acts as the glue to hold it all together.
